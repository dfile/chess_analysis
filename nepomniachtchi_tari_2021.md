Nepomniachtchi v Tari 2021

1. c4 
This is the English Opening. I have never played this opening, and rarely face it. I took this opportunity to look up the main lines. The most common response for Black is 1... Nf6 according to chess.com; although, Tari’s response 1. e5 seems much more logical, and in fact chess.com says that it is statistically much better for Black than Nf6.
1.. e5
2.Nc3

Another popular move is 2. g3. This is a more flexible move which also avoids Tari’s next move 2.. Bb3. Nepo opts for 3. Nd5. The idea here is that blacks dark square bishop has possible retreat squares a5, c5, and e7. I suppose Bc5 could be met by b4, but chess.com tells me this isn’t a great move. Tari plays 3.. Be7.

4.Nf6 d6 5. g3 Nf6

White eventually plays g3 looking to play Bg2 I expect, and black challenges the white knight which has already moved twice. 6. Nc3. I like Black’s position at this point: he has a pawn in the center, two pieces developed, and he’s ready to castle Kingside. 

6.. c5 
7.Bg3
Black strengthens his center. Black’s dark square bishop looks kind of useless for now, but can be improved. White’s light square bishop looks like it could be very effective.

Skipping ahead to 11. Nd5. I’m not sure what white is going for here. This is the fourth time he’s moved that knight and he has pieces that are undeveloped. 11.. Nxd5. 12. cxd5 All those moves to trade his knight.

12.. Bh3. A technique I use against fianchettoed bishops. I like this because the move g3 created weaknesses around the king, and white invested two moves in the fianchetto.

After exchanging bishops... 14.. f5. Wow! My usual idea is to get my knight and queen near the king in this situation, and maybe advance the h pawn to force open the kings protection. Here black is using his very nice pawn center to attack White. White still has an under developed queenside and his bishop is blocked by his knight. I don’t love 15. f4. He might have been better to wait for black to play f4 and close things up.

By move 23 White’s king is very exposed and he plays Rg1 followed by Kh1. He’s looking for an attack, but Black’s king looks well defended. Black grabs the pawns on e4 and f4. White doubles rooks on the d file. He has 2 rooks and a Bishop pointed at the g7 pawn. Black is defending with one rook, his queen, and king. I did not see the next clever move from Tari 26.. Rg4 disconnecting the white rooks. After trading rooks white plays 28. Qxd3 grabbing the scary looking passed pawn. We’re I black I might have been tempted to advance this pawn sooner. Tari finds a nice tactic after  28.. Nb4 threatening the white queen. The position is very open, so white may not have wanted to trade bishop for knight. Instead 29. Qe4. Re7. The white queen can go to c4, f4, or g2. Unfortunately white chooses f4 which loses a pawn, but clears the a2-g8 diagonal to attack the black king. 

30.. Nxd5 
31. Qc4. 
At this point Black is up 3 pawns, the black king is safe, the position is open, and the white king is totally exposed. After unpinning his knight, Tari plays 31.. Qd1+ forking the Bishop and king. White is going to lose a piece and then Ne3 may cost him a rook.
